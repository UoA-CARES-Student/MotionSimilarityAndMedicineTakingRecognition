### <i> OBJECTIVE: </i> To research, analyse and develop an 'exercise and medicine consumption recognition' system for elderly COPD patients to use from the comforts of their home
<br/>

## Project Goals 
1. Determining if a prescribed exercise is being performed, and to what accuracy
2. Determining if a prescribed medicine is being consumed

## Project Structure

## Project Setup 

## Dataset

## Training

1. If wanting to run motion_similarity.train script internally, just change import to 'import folder_setup'
This script by default will run some tests on the 'test' subset of data and propose a confusion matrix on those samples along with an accuracy and precision score for the 'test' subset

Similarly train: (from motion_similarity import preprocess)
          preprocess: (from motion_similarity import folder_setup)
